# POI Project (Points of Interest)

## About
This project aims to implement a convenient and informative service for tourists, providing a roadmap with Points of Interest. These are marks on the map which describe popular tourist places, show people thoughts, discussions, photos, testimonials, etc. Furthermore, it is possible to personalize the map, marking visited or planned to visit places and countries and share with other users. In long term the service would support automated content management like moderation, description updates, etc. and possibly could integrate with other useful services like booking hotels, flights and cars.

## Features
* You have the whole world on your map. Find every place you want
* Learn what people think about a country/city
* Contribute by leaving your photos, comments and thoughts
* Communicate with people in group discussion chats
* Create your traveling todo list and share your plans with others

## Development
The service is going to be developed using Kotlin, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Angular 5, Google APIs
